## Setup & Configuration

### Supported Language Versions

This SDK is compatible with the following versions: `Python >= 3.7`

### Installation

To get started with the SDK, we recommend installing using `pip`:

```bash
pip install webdev_sdk
```

## Authentication

### Access Token Authentication

The WebdevSdk API uses an Access Token for authentication.

This token must be provided to authenticate your requests to the API.

#### Setting the Access Token

When you initialize the SDK, you can set the access token as follows:

```py
WebdevSdk(
    access_token="YOUR_ACCESS_TOKEN",
    timeout=10000
)
```

If you need to set or update the access token after initializing the SDK, you can use:

```py
sdk.set_access_token("YOUR_ACCESS_TOKEN")
```

## Setting a Custom Timeout

You can set a custom timeout for the SDK's HTTP requests as follows:

```py
from webdev_sdk import WebdevSdk

sdk = WebdevSdk(timeout=10000)
```

# Sample Usage

Below is a comprehensive example demonstrating how to authenticate and call a simple endpoint:

```py
from webdev_sdk import WebdevSdk

sdk = WebdevSdk(
    access_token="YOUR_ACCESS_TOKEN",
    timeout=10000
)

result = sdk.v0.read_root_v0_admin_get()

print(result)

```
