# webdev-sdk

WebDev SDK is a tool that generates websites using AI. It is designed so that you can create a webpage automatically with the ability to control the result if it is required.

First you need to register on the [hub.oto.dev](https://hub.oto.dev/) service and create an API Key which is necessary for using the SDK. Please note that the service has a free plan by default, which will be subject to a number of restrictions in the future. To remove restrictions and get more advanced features, you may want to consider a paid subscription version.
