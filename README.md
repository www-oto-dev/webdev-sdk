# WebDev SDK (Python)

WebDev SDK is a tool that generates websites using AI. It is designed so that you can create a webpage automatically with the ability to control the result if it is required.

SDK is using the [web.oto.dev](https://web.oto.dev/) service. Please note that the service has a free plan by default, which will be subject to a number of restrictions in the future. You may want to consider a paid subscription version to remove restrictions and get more advanced features.


1. First, you need to **register on the [hub.oto.dev](https://hub.oto.dev/) service and copy an `API Key`** from the Dashboard
2. **Create a project and copy project ID** which is necessary for using the SDK

## Project Settings


```
project_id = 'YOU_PROJECT_ID'
api_key = 'YOUR_API_KEY'
```
