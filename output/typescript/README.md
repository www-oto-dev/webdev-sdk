# Setup & Configuration

## Supported Language Versions

This SDK is compatible with the following versions: `TypeScript >= 4.8.4`

## Installation

To get started with the SDK, we recommend installing using `npm`:

```bash
npm install webdev-sdk
```

## Authentication

### Access Token Authentication

The WebdevSdk API uses an Access Token for authentication.

This token must be provided to authenticate your requests to the API.

#### Setting the Access Token

When you initialize the SDK, you can set the access token as follows:

```ts
const sdk = new WebdevSdk({ token: 'YOUR_TOKEN' });
```

If you need to set or update the access token after initializing the SDK, you can use:

```ts
const sdk = new WebdevSdk();
sdk.token = 'YOUR_TOKEN';
```

## Setting a Custom Timeout

You can set a custom timeout for the SDK's HTTP requests as follows:

```ts
const webdevSdk = new WebdevSdk({ timeout: 10000 });
```

# Sample Usage

Below is a comprehensive example demonstrating how to authenticate and call a simple endpoint:

```ts
import { WebdevSdk } from 'webdev-sdk';

(async () => {
  const webdevSdk = new WebdevSdk({
    token: 'YOUR_TOKEN',
  });

  const { data } = await webdevSdk.v0.readRootV0AdminGet();

  console.log(data);
})();
```
