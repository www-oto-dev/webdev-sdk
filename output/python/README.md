## Setup & Configuration

### Supported Language Versions

This SDK is compatible with the following versions: `Python >= 3.7`

### Installation

To get started with the SDK, we recommend installing using `pip`:

```bash
pip install web_oto_dev_sdk
```

## Authentication

### API Key Authentication

The WebOtoDevSdk API uses API keys as a form of authentication. An API key is a unique identifier used to authenticate a user, developer, or a program that is calling the API.

#### Setting the API key

When you initialize the SDK, you can set the API key as follows:

```py
WebOtoDevSdk(
    api_key="YOUR_API_KEY",
    api_key_header="YOUR_API_KEY_HEADER",
    timeout=10000
)
```

If you need to set or update the API key after initializing the SDK, you can use:

```py
sdk.set_api_key("YOUR_API_KEY", "YOUR_API_KEY_HEADER")
```

## Setting a Custom Timeout

You can set a custom timeout for the SDK's HTTP requests as follows:

```py
from web_oto_dev_sdk import WebOtoDevSdk

sdk = WebOtoDevSdk(timeout=10000)
```

# Sample Usage

Below is a comprehensive example demonstrating how to authenticate and call a simple endpoint:

```py
from web_oto_dev_sdk import WebOtoDevSdk

sdk = WebOtoDevSdk(
    api_key="YOUR_API_KEY",
    api_key_header="YOUR_API_KEY_HEADER",
    timeout=10000
)

result = sdk.admin.get_projects_admin_projects_get()

print(result)

```
